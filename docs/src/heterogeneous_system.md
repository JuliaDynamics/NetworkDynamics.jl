# Modeling a heterogeneous system

One of the main purposes of NetworkDynamics.jl is to facilitate
modeling coupled systems with heterogenities. This means that
components can differ in their parameters as well as in their dynamics.


## Heterogenous parameters
We start by setting up a simple system of Kuramoto oscillators.

```@example heterogeneous_system
using NetworkDynamics, OrdinaryDiffEq, Plots, Graphs


N = 8
g = watts_strogatz(N,2,0) # ring network

function kuramoto_edge!(e, θ_s, θ_d, K, t)
    e[1] = K * sin(θ_s[1] - θ_d[1])
end

function kuramoto_vertex!(dθ, θ, edges, ω, t)
    dθ[1] = ω
    sum_coupling!(dθ, edges)
end

vertex! = ODEVertex(f = kuramoto_vertex!, dim = 1, sym=[:θ])
edge!   = StaticEdge(f = kuramoto_edge!, dim = 1)
nd! = network_dynamics(vertex!, edge!, g);
nothing #hide
```

Introducing heterogeneous parameters is as easy as defining an array.
Here the vertex parameters are heterogeneous, while the edges share the same coupling
parameter K.

```@example heterogeneous_system
ω = collect(1:N)./N
ω  .-= sum(ω)/N
K  = 3.
p  = (ω, K); # p[1] vertex parameters, p[2] edge parameters
nothing #hide
```

Integrate and plot

```@example heterogeneous_system
x0 = collect(1:N)./N
x0 .-= sum(x0)./N
tspan = (0., 10.)
prob = ODEProblem(nd!, x0, tspan, p)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
plot(sol, ylabel="θ", fmt = :png)
```

## Heterogeneous dynamics

Two paradigmatic modifications of the node model above are static nodes and nodes with
inertia. A static node has no internal dynamics and instead fixes the variable at a
constant value. A Kuramoto model with inertia consists of two internal variables leading to
more complicated (and for many applications more realistic) local dynamics.

```@example heterogeneous_system
static! = StaticVertex(f = (θ, edges, c, t) -> θ .= c, dim = 1, sym = [:θ])


function kuramoto_inertia!(dv, v, edges, P, t)
    dv[1] = v[2]
    dv[2] = P - 1. * v[2]
    for e in edges
        dv[2] += e[1]
    end
end

inertia! = ODEVertex(f = kuramoto_inertia!, dim = 2, sym= [:θ, :ω]);
nothing #hide
```

Since now we model a system with heterogeneous node dynamics we can no longer
straightforwardly pass a single VertexFunction to `network_dynamics` but instead have to
hand over an Array.

```@example heterogeneous_system
vertex_array    = Array{VertexFunction}([vertex! for i = 1:N])
vertex_array[1] = static!
vertex_array[5] = inertia! # index should correspond to the node's index in the graph
nd_hetero!   = network_dynamics(vertex_array, edge!, g);
nothing #hide
```

Now we have to take a bit more care with defining initial conditions and parameters.
For the static! node the initial condition has to match its parameter. For simplicity
we use the same parameters as above.

```@example heterogeneous_system
x0[1] = ω[1];
nothing #hide
```

The node with inertia is two-dimensional, hence we need to specify two initial conditions.
For the first dimension we keep the initial conditions from above and insert! another one into `x0` at
the correct index.

```@example heterogeneous_system
inertia_ic_2 = 5
insert!(x0, 6, inertia_ic_2);
nothing #hide
```

`x0[1:4]` holds ic for nodes 1 to 4, `x0[5:6]` holds the two
initial conditions for node 5, `x0[7:9]` holds initial conditions for nodes 6 to 8.

```@example heterogeneous_system
prob_hetero = ODEProblem(nd_hetero!, x0, tspan, p)
sol_hetero = solve(prob_hetero, Rodas4());
nothing #hide
```

For clarity we plot only the variables referring to the oscillator's angle θ and color
them according to their type.

```@example heterogeneous_system
membership = ones(Int64, N)
membership[1] = 2
membership[5] = 3
nodecolor = [colorant"lightseagreen", colorant"orange", colorant"darkred"];
nodefillc = reshape(nodecolor[membership], 1, N);

vars = syms_containing(nd_hetero!, :θ);
plot(sol_hetero, ylabel="θ", vars=vars, lc = nodefillc, fmt = :png)
```

## Components with algebraic constraints

If one of the network components contains an algebraic as well as dynamical component,
then there is the option to supply a mass matrix for the given component. In general this
will look as follows:

```@example heterogeneous_system
function edgeA!(de, e, v_s, v_d, p, t)
    de[1] = f(e, v_s, v_d, p, t) # dynamic variable
    e[2]  = g(e, v_s, v_d, p, t) # static variable
end

M = zeros(2,2)
M[1,1] = 1

nd_edgeA! = ODEEdge(f = edgeA!, dim = 2, coupling=:undirected, mass_matrix = M);
nothing #hide
```

This handles the second equations as `0 = M[2,2] * de[2] = g(e, v_s, v_d, p, t) - e[2]`.

See the example kuramoto_plasticity.jl and the discussion on [github](https://github.com/pik-icone/NetworkDynamics.jl/issues/45#issuecomment-659491913) for more details.
