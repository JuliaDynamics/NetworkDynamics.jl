# # Modeling a heterogeneous system
#
#
# One of the main purposes of NetworkDynamics.jl is to facilitate
# modeling coupled systems with heterogenities. This means that
# components can differ in their parameters as well as in their dynamics.
#
# ## Heterogenous parameters
#
# We start by setting up a simple system of Kuramoto oscillators.

# To assign parameters, we can create a `NWParameter` object based on the `nw` definition.
# This parameter object will be pre-filled with the default parameters.

p = NWParameter(nw)

# To set the vertex parameters, we can use indexing of the `p.v` field:

ω = collect(1:N) ./ N
ω .-= sum(ω) / N
p.v[:, :ω0] = ω

# Here, the index pairing `:, :ω` is used to index state ω for all node indices.
#
# The parameter object contains information about the network structure. For the
# actual problem definition we need to throw away this wrapper and use the
# flat-vector representation of the parameters `pflat(p)`. Note that `pflat(p)`
#
# Similarily, we could use `NWState(nw)` to create an indexable wrapper of the
# initial state. However in this case we can also fill create the flat state
# array manually:

x0 = collect(1:N) ./ N
x0 .-= sum(x0) ./ N
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)
prob = ODEProblem(nw, x0, tspan, pflat(p))
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
plot(sol; ylabel="θ", fmt=:png)

# ## Heterogeneous dynamics
#
# Two paradigmatic modifications of the node model above are static nodes and nodes with
# inertia.
# A static node has no internal states and instead fixes the variable at a
# constant value.

function static_g(out, u, p, t)
    out[1] = p[1]
    nothing
end
static! = VertexModel(g=static_g, outsym=[:θ], psym=[:θfix => ω[1]], name=:static)

# But wait! NetworkDynamics classified this as `PureFeedForward`, because it cannot
# distinguish between the function signatures
# ```
# g(out, u, p, t)    # PureFeedForward
# g(out, ins, p, t)  # NoFeedForward
# ```
# and since `dim(u)=0` it wrongfully assumes that the latter is meant.
# We can overwrite the classification by passing the ff keyword:

static! = VertexModel(g=static_g, outsym=[:θ], psym=[:θfix => ω[1]], ff=NoFeedForward(), name=:static)

# A Kuramoto model with inertia consists of two internal variables leading to
# more complicated (and for many applications more realistic) local dynamics.

function kuramoto_inertia!(dv, v, esum, (ω0,), t)
    dv[1] = v[2]
    dv[2] = ω0 - 1.0 * v[2] + esum[1]
    nothing
end

inertia! = VertexModel(f=kuramoto_inertia!, g=1:1, sym=[:θ, :ω], psym=[:ω0], name=:inertia)

# Since now we model a system with heterogeneous node dynamics we can no longer
# straightforwardly pass a single VertexModel to the `Network` constructor but
# instead have to hand over an Array.

vertex_array[1] = static!
vertex_array[5] = inertia! # index should correspond to the node's index in the graph
nw_hetero! = Network(g, vertex_array, edge!)

# Now we have to take a bit more care with defining initial conditions and parameters.
#
# First, we can generate a `NWState` object based on the `nw_hetero!` object which
# will be populated with the default values.

state = NWState(nw_hetero!)

# The node with inertia is two-dimensional, hence we need to specify two initial conditions.
# For the first dimension we keep the initial conditions from above and insert! another one into `x0` at
# the correct index.
#
# For the θ states we will use the same initial conditins as before:

state.v[2:8,:θ] = x0[2:8]

# We're still missing one initial condition: the second variable ω of the 5th vertex.

state.v[5,:ω] = 5

# The `NWState` object also contains a parameter object accessible via `state.p`.
# The edge parameters are already filled with default values.
# The vertex parameters can be copied from our old parmeter object `p`.

state.p.v[2:8, :ω0] = p.v[2:8, :ω0]

# For the problem construction, we need to convert the nested stuctures to flat arrays using the `uflat` and `pflat` methods.
