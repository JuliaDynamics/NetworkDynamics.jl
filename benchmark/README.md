# Benchmarking of NetworkDynamics

The ND benchmarks are defined in [benchmarks.jl](benchmarks.jl).

All benchmarks belong to a central benchmark suite `SUITE`. A benchmark
suit is basically a dictionary of defined benchmarks. After a run
of the benchmarks one can access the individual trials via the same syntax.

The benchmarks will be run using `PkgBenchmark.jl`. Make sure that you
have this pkg in your global environment so it is loadable! Otherwise we'd
have to add this to the `NetworkDynamics.jl` deps...

The easiest way to run the benchmarks is

```
$ cd NetworkDynamics/benchmarks
$ ./run_benchmarks.jl
```

which will run the benchmark defined in the current directory

  - for the currently checked out version of ND
  - for main

and export the results to `target.md`, `baseline.md` and `judgment.md`.

See `$./run_benchmarks.jl --help` for list of arguments.
