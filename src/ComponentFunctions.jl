    StaticEdge(f!, dim, sym)

Wrapper that ensures compatibility of a **mutating** function `f!` with
the key constructor `network_dynamics`.

`f!`  describes the local behaviour at a static edge and has to respect
the following calling syntax

```julia
f!(e, v_s, v_t, p, t) -> nothing
```

Here  `e`, `p` and `t` are the usual arguments, while
`v_s` and `v_d` are arrays containing the vertices which are
the source and destination of the described edge.

- `dim` is the number of independent variables in the edge equations and
- `sym` is an array of symbols for these variables.
- `coupling` is a Symbol describing if the EdgeFunction is intended for a directed graph (`:directed`) or for an undirected graph (`{:undirected, :symmetric, :antisymmetric, :fiducial}`). `:directed` is intended for directed graphs. `:undirected` is the default option and is only compatible with SimpleGraph. in this case f! should specify the coupling from a source vertex to a destination vertex. `:symmetric` and `:antisymmetric` trigger performance optimizations, if `f!` has that symmetry property. `:fiducial` lets the user specify both the coupling from src to dst, as well as the coupling from dst to src and is intended for advanced users.
